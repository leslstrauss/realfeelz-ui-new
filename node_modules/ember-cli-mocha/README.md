# ember-cli-mocha

Mocha / Chai testing for your Ember CLI apps.

## Installation

Remove QUnit from your ember-cli app:

```sh
npm rm ember-cli-qunit --save-dev
bower uninstall --save ember-qunit
bower uninstall --save qunit
bower uninstall --save ember-qunit-notifications
```

Install ember-cli-mocha:

```sh
npm install ember-cli-mocha --save-dev
ember generate ember-cli-mocha
```

Important: If you receive the conflict message "Unable to find suitable version
for ember-cli-test-loader" during the last step, choose the "test-agnostic"
branch. This dependency issue should be resolved soon.

## Usage

ember-cli-mocha overrides all of ember-cli's testing blueprints. Simply generate
models, controllers, components, etc. in order to generate the corresponding Mocha
/ Chai tests.

Tests rely on [ember-mocha](https://github.com/switchfly/ember-mocha) modules
and helpers. Please refer to that project to understand detailed usage.
